            Ingredients: 
            <ul>
                <li>Sea Salt</li>
                <li>Lamb</li>
                <li>Canola oil</li>
            </ul>

                This is a pretty easy recipe, so I'm just going to get right into it. Because the lamb chops are fairly thick, you'll have to sear them in a cast-iron pan on the stove and then pop them in the oven. Two step cooking!

            <ol>
                <li>Bring your lamb chops to room temperature.</li>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle all sides (top, bottom, sides, just not the bone-side) with Sea Salt</li>
                <li>Heat up a couple tablespoons of canola oil on an 8-10” cast iron pan.</li>
                <li>When the oil is glistening, it's go time.</li>
                <li>Repeat this searing process for each side of meat—top, bottom, left, and right.</li>
                <li>Serve! With some crispy greens like, I don't know, brussels sprouts!</li>
            </ol>
